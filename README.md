Project is a simple meme generator to showcase understanding of using JavaScript with HTML and CSS. The focus was on DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation, event listening/handling, and form handling.
- A form was created in the HTML portion with classes that identify the "top meme" and "bottom meme"
- Form generates a meme image which can be any image link
- Top Text label will display text on top of the image.
- Bottom Text label will display text on the bottom of the image.
- Hitting "Create Meme!" will generate your meme.
- Multiple meme's can be added. - using box sizing with CSS to populate new memes in separate spaces on the page
- There is also a "Remove" button which removes the images from the page when clicked.
